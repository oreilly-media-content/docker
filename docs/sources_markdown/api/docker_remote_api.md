Docker Remote API
=================

1. Brief introduction
---------------------

-   The Remote API is replacing rcli
-   By default the Docker daemon listens on unix:///var/run/docker.sock
    and the client must have root access to interact with the daemon
-   If a group named *docker* exists on your system, docker will apply
    ownership of the socket to the group
-   The API tends to be REST, but for some complex commands, like attach
    or pull, the HTTP connection is hijacked to transport stdout stdin
    and stderr
-   Since API version 1.2, the auth configuration is now handled client
    side, so the client has to send the authConfig as POST in
    /images/(name)/push

2. Versions
-----------

The current version of the API is 1.6

Calling /images/\<name\>/insert is the same as calling
/v1.6/images/\<name\>/insert

You can still call an old version of the api using
/v1.0/images/\<name\>/insert

#### What's new

Builder (/build):

-   Simplify the upload of the build context
-   Simply stream a tarball instead of multipart upload with 4
    intermediary buffers
-   Simpler, less memory usage, less disk usage and faster

> **warning**
>
> The /build improvements are not reverse-compatible. Pre 1.3 clients
> will break on /build.

List containers (/containers/json):

-   You can use size=1 to get the size of the containers

Start containers (/containers/\<id\>/start):

-   You can now pass host-specific configuration (e.g. bind mounts) in
    the POST body for start calls
